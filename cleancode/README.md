# 97 Things every Java Programmer should know - notes
## Behavior Is "Easy"; State Is Hard
> When I was first introduced to object-oriented programming, some of the very first concepts taught were the triple of polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation. And to be honest, we spent quite some time trying to understand and code with them. But, at least for me, too much emphasis was given to the first two, and very little to the third and most important of all: encapsulation.

> Encapsulation allows us to tame the growing state and complexity that is a constant in the software development field. The idea that we can internalize the state, hide it from other components, and offer only a carefully designed API surface for any state mutation is core to the design and coding of complex information systems
